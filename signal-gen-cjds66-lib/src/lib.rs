/*! An unofficial support library which can fully remote control 
the inexpensive `"Koolertron DDS Signal Generator"` known as `"GH-CJDS66"` 
(Full name: 
`"Koolertron Upgraded 60MHz DDS Signal Generator Counter, High Precision Dual-channel Arbitrary Waveform Function Generator Frequency Meter 200MSa/s (60MHz) Model: GH-CJDS66-FU"`
). Perhaps it also works with other similar DDS Signal Generators, 
although that hasn't been tested.  
  
This has been written following the official manufacturer's USB-serial 
communication protocol specification. The library implements support for 
every working manufacturer-documented feature from the spec, and only a 
few extra convenience features mentioned at the end of the spec have been 
left out, because they didn't seem to work as advertised.  
  
The few extra missing features probably aren't really needed, but will 
happily be added anyway if someone would like to figure out how/if they 
work, and explain them to the author. You can read about what's still 
missing in 
[the commit message of this git commit](https://gitlab.com/defcronyke/signal-gen-cjds66/-/commit/713b026a4e10807d23f7436d26649dcc4c584019), 
and file an issue or open a merge request about it on GitLab if you figure 
something out or you'd like to discuss it further.

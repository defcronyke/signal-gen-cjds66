Purpose:  
-------  
This is an unofficial project which fully implements the official 
communication spec for the DDS Signal Generator and Counter device
known as the "Koolertron Upgraded 60MHz DDS Signal Generator Counter, 
High Precision Dual-channel Arbitrary Waveform Function Generator 
Frequency Meter 200MSa/s (60MHz) Model: GH-CJDS66-FU" (less a few spec 
errata, which you can read about in a commit message here:

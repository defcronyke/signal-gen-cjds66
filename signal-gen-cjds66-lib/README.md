Purpose:  
-------  
This is an unofficial project which fully implements the official 
communication spec for the DDS Signal Generator and Counter device
known as the "Koolertron Upgraded 60MHz DDS Signal Generator Counter, 
High Precision Dual-channel Arbitrary Waveform Function Generator 
Frequency Meter 200MSa/s (60MHz) Model: GH-CJDS66-FU" (less a few spec 
errata, which you can read about in a commit message here:
[713b026a4e10807d23f7436d26649dcc4c584019](https://gitlab.com/defcronyke/signal-gen-cjds66/-/commit/713b026a4e10807d23f7436d26649dcc4c584019))

Basic Usage Code Example:  
------------------------  
**Getting Started:**  
  * This library is published as a Rust crate on crates.io, so 
  that you can use it in your own projects easily:  
  [https://crates.io/crates/signal-gen-cjds66-lib](https://crates.io/crates/signal-gen-cjds66-lib)

  * The crate's auto-generated documentation can be viewed on docs.rs here:  
  [https://docs.rs/signal-gen-cjds66-lib](https://docs.rs/signal-gen-cjds66-lib)

  * You can also download the latest development version docs here if you
  want the docs for the master branch (development version) of the crate.
  This version also includes the docs for the associated command line program:  
  [signal-gen-cjds66 docs (Development Version)](https://gitlab.com/defcronyke/signal-gen-cjds66/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=docs)

  * To use this crate, put the following lines in your Rust project's
  `Cargo.toml` file (but substitute the newest version number 
  listed at the crates.io link above so you're using the 
  latest version):
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  signal-gen-cjds66-lib = { version = "0.1" }
  ```

  * **IMPORTANT:** Note that this crate uses three-part version numbers, 
  such as `0.1.7`, but it's better to leave off the third part of the 
  version number in your `Cargo.toml` file, because that way you can more 
  easily and automatically update to the latest `0.1.x` versions, without 
  having to update that third number by hand. It would be annoying 
  otherwise, since that third number may need to change frequently.  
  
**Code Example - Print the device's model number and serial number:**  
`examples/basic-usage.rs`  
```rust
/*! A basic usage example for the library.  
  
Control one signal generator device on 
Linux or Windows. Print the device's 
model number and serial number.
*/

	result, which will either be Ok(0) on success,
	or some type of error.

	/* Exit the program, returning an appropriate
	exit code to the parent shell or execution 
	environment. This is important so whoever
	ran this program (a bash or batch script maybe)
	can check if anything went wrong while the 
	program was running, and react accordingly.

	multiple devices in sequence.  

	NOTE: The values listed below are the default values
	used by the first connected serial device on my 
	Linux and Windows systems. If you get a connection
	error when you run this code, make sure your signal
	generator is plugged into your computer and powered
	on.  

	If you still have a connection error, you'll probably 
	need to find the correct path for your system and 
	change the values below so they	are pointing at the

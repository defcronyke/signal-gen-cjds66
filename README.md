Purpose:  
-------  
Control one or many GH-CJDS66 60MHz Signal Generators from the
command line. Tested and working on Linux and Windows, and might
also work on Mac.  
  
This is an unofficial project which fully implements the official 
communication spec for the DDS Signal Generator and Counter device
known as the "Koolertron Upgraded 60MHz DDS Signal Generator Counter, 
High Precision Dual-channel Arbitrary Waveform Function Generator 
Frequency Meter 200MSa/s (60MHz) Model: GH-CJDS66-FU" (less a few spec 
errata, which you can read about in a commit message here:
[713b026a4e10807d23f7436d26649dcc4c584019](https://gitlab.com/defcronyke/signal-gen-cjds66/-/commit/713b026a4e10807d23f7436d26649dcc4c584019))

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE:  
----------------------  
You can download the latest Linux x86_64 development build here:
[signal-gen-cjds66 Linux x86_64 binary (latest build)](https://gitlab.com/defcronyke/signal-gen-cjds66/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build)  
  
It passed all the automated tests, but it should be considered
somewhat experimental, since it's not a numbered release version.
Feel free to try it if you aren't concerned about potential bugs
and you just want to get going quickly with the newest version
of the program.  
  
Binary releases for the numbered release versions may be available 
at some point, but this is written in the Rust programming language, 
which makes it easy enough to compile the project from source yourself, 
and it's recommended you do that anyway for less chance of problems.  
  
1. Install the Rust programming language toolchain from:  
[https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)  
  
2. Make sure you have Git installed, and clone this project's git 
repository onto your computer:  
```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/defcronyke/signal-gen-cjds66.git
cd signal-gen-cjds66
```  
  
3. Compile and run the program (with the -h flag to display the help 
output so you can see how to use it):  
```shell
cargo run --release -- -h
```  
  
4. You can now use the program the same way as above, and it will only be
recompiled as-needed if any changes are made to the source code. Note that
any command line switches and args must come after the two dashes "--", 
like where you see the -h flag above. You can also optionally omit the 
--release switch if you'd prefer to be using a debug build of the program:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- <any switches or args go here>
```  
  
5. (Optional) If you prefer to run the compiled program directly, instead
of with the Rust toolchain's "cargo" helper command, after running the 
above cargo command for the first time, you can find the compiled binary 
for this program in the `target/release` folder.  
  
You can run it like this on Linux:  
```shell
cd target/release
./signal-gen-cjds66 -h
```  
  
On Windows you can run it like this:  
```shell
cd target\release
signal-gen-cjds66.exe -h
```  
  
6. (Optional) You can add the -v switch to the end of any command
to get a different and more verbose style of output. Useful for
debugging and to better understand what's happening when you run
a command. For example, to get the verbose output while requesting
the device's model number and serial number, run this command:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- --ms -v
```  

7. (Optional) You can specify the device location if the default
isn't correct for your computer or configuration. On Linux it 
defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0, and on Windows it defaults to COM3. You
can change it or even specify multiple devices to control with the
-d switch, like this:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- -d /dev/ttyUSB2 -d /dev/ttyUSB5
```  
  
Or on Windows you would do the same, but with names like COM4 or 
COM5, like this:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- -d COM4 -d COM5
```  
  
When you specify multiple devices, all commands will be executed 
on the first device first, and then on the next device immediately
afterwards.  
  
IMPORTANT: You can run this program with multiple command line 
switches all in one invocation, and when you do that, the commands
will be executed in a predefined order, NOT the order which you add
the switches in the command invocation. An attempt has been made to
define execution in a reasonable order which should work for most
use-cases, but if you need things to run in a different order,
you'll need to run the program multiple times instead. Maybe you can
write a script and call this program from inside there multiple times 
if you want it automated nicely, with things happening in a custom 
order. If you'd like to see the exact order that things will run in, 
you can take a look in the `src/main.rs` file. The commands will run 
top-to-bottom in the order their corresponding functions appear in 
that source file. If you aren't sure which command line switches 
those functions correspond with, you can cross-reference the switch 
names with the entries of the same name listed in the file named 
`clap.yaml`. The execution order might change in newer versions of 
this program, if a better order is determined after receiving 
feedback from users and using it for longer, so please don't assume 
this execution order will never change between versions.  
  
  
UPDATE TO THE LATEST COMMIT OR USE A SPECIFIC NUMBERED VERSION:  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
If you cloned this project awhile ago and you'd like to update
to a newer version, run this command:  
```shell
git pull
```  
  
Numbered release versions (a.k.a. git "tags") of this project are intended 
to be more stable, and it's recommended for you to always run the
highest-numbered tag version listed in the project repo, rather than the newest
commit in the master branch, for best results. Using the master branch at a 
non-numbered version should be considered experimental. It's not recommended 
and results may vary.  
  
To find the currently available numbered versions of this project, run this 
command:  
```shell
git tag
```  
  
If there's any numbered versions available, it should output some versions, 
such as for example:  
```shell
v0.1.1
v0.1.2
```  
  
In the example above, v0.1.2 is the highest-numbered version available, 
so it should be preferred unless you have some personal reason not to 
prefer it. To use that version of the project, run this command:  
```shell
git checkout v0.1.2
```  
  
IMPORTANT: If you're running a numbered version and you'd like to update
the project with any newly-available code, switch back from the numbered
version to the master branch, then update with the git pull command, and
after that you can see any new available versions and switch to using them
as you like. For example:  
```shell
git checkout master
git pull
git tag
git checkout v0.1.3
```  
  
  
Tutorial - Design a Custom Wave:  
-------------------------------  
1. Download Waveform Manager Plus (this has been tested with v4.13):  
[https://www.aimtti.com/resources/waveform-manager-plus-v413](https://www.aimtti.com/resources/waveform-manager-plus-v413)  
  
2. Unzip it and install it with wine (it's Windows-only but works well 
in wine):  
```shell
wine start waveman.msi
```  
  
3. Run the program with wine:  
```shell
cd ~/".wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Waveman"
wine waveman.exe
```  
  
4. Design a new waveform of amplitude 4096 and length 2048, and save 
it as format: `"WaveCAD *.wav"`  
  
5. Upload the wave to the device, saving it into slot 1:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- --wwc 1,<the-filename-here.wav>
```  
  
6. Set the device to use the custom wave you just uploaded, for channel
1 output:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- -a 1
```  
  
  
Tutorial - Upload an Audio File to the Device:  
---------------------------------------------  
1. Using some program such as Audacity 
([https://www.audacityteam.org](https://www.audacityteam.org)), 
export your desired audio as a 16-bit .wav file, and it's recommended 
that you use a very low-quality project rate such as 8000 Hz, so you 
can fit a longer amount of the audio onto the device.  
  
2. Upload the .wav file as an arbitrary waveform onto the device, 
saving it in slot 1:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- --wwc 1,<the-filename-here.wav>
```  
  
3. Set the device to use the custom wave you just uploaded, for channel
1 output:  
```shell
cargo run --release -- -a 1
```  
  
IMPORTANT: The device can only store the first 2048 numbers contained 
in the .wav file, which is a very short duration of audio data. It's 
important that you provide a .wav file with at least 2048 numbers in 
it. At a project rate of 8000 Hz, that should require a stereo audio 
file with duration of at least 126.5 milliseconds. The extra data will 
be omitted from the upload to the device.

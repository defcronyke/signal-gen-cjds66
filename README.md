Tutorial - Design a Wave:  
------------------------  
1. Download Waveform Manager Plus (this has been tested with v4.13):  
     https://www.aimtti.com/resources/waveform-manager-plus-v413  
  
2. Unzip it and install it with wine (it's Windows-only but works well in wine):  
     wine start waveman.msi  
  
3. Run the program with wine:  
     cd ~/".wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Waveman"  
     wine waveman.exe  
  
4. Design a new waveform of amplitude 4096 and length 2048, and save it as format "WaveCAD *.wav".
